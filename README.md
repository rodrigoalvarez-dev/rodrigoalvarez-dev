# Rodrigo Álvarez

Project Manager on the outside, Web Engineer on the inside.

I’ve spent ~20 years building and maintaining web systems, mostly on the backend.  
These days I work as a Project Manager, but I stay close to code to keep architecture, quality, and long-term maintainability grounded in reality.

I care about:
- software that survives its creators  
- boring, predictable systems (the highest compliment in production)
- clear boundaries between domain, infrastructure, and delivery

## What I’m working on

- Migrating personal and side projects toward **Symfony** and **Spring Boot**
- Exploring **Vue / React** with a backend-first mindset
- Building small, opinionated tools (time tracking, internal portals, content sites)
- Sharpening leadership skills without drifting away from technical depth

## Tech I’m comfortable with

Backend: PHP (Symfony, Laravel), REST APIs, .NET Core, Java, async workflows, relational databases  
Architecture: SOLID, hexagonal, DDD-inspired designs  
Infra: Docker, Linux servers, CI/CD, pragmatic DevOps  
Frontend (when needed): Tailwind, Alpine, Vue, React

## Beyond work

Vegan since 2014.  
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu brown belt.  
Father of two.  
I like systems, silence, and things that make sense.
